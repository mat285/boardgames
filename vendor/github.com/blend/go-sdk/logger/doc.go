/*
Package logger is our high throughput event bus.

It has two main modes of output; text and json, and allows multiple listeners to be triggerd for a given logger event.

The output is governed by the `LOG_FORMAT` environment variable. Text output is the default, which
is great for reading locally, but is less than optimal for search and automated ingestion. In
production systems, `LOG_FORMAT=json` is recommended.
